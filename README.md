# odin-recipes
This is the first Foundations path project on Odin Project! For it, we had to make a simple recipe website with three recipes and a homepage, with links used to navigate to each recipe at the homepage and back to home from each recipe.

As someone who's had to learn web development for school, this project was also like a review or a refresher to me, but also the lesson material at Odin Project taught me a whole lot of other things that weren't at the classes I've attended at school.

Finishing this project has given me a sense of achievement and accomplishment, as simple as the website is. I can't wait to make more projects in the future.
