        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When people think of Filipino <i>adobo</i>, what would come to mind would most likely be chicken or pork <i>adobo</i>.
                There are many other types of <i>adobo</i>, however, that are likely not as known in other countries.
                For those who love veggies, we have <i>adobong sitaw</i> and <i>adobong kangkong</i>, the main ingredient in those
                being snake beans and water spinach respectively. There's even <i>adobong atay at balunbalunan</i>, made of chicken liver
                and gizzard. As for this recipe, <i>adobong pusit</i>, is a seafood <i>adobo</i>, made of squid firstly boiled in soy sauce
                and vinegar, then later sauteed in garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It's a dish with a rich taste, one that reminds many of us Filipinos of home.</p>

        <p>For this dish, any kind of squid would do, but small to medium sized is ideal. Given that it's a squid dish, do not cook it longer than
            the indicated time to preserve its tender texture. In the case you end up with a rubbery-textured squid, try cooking it some more.
            The number of ingredients is suitable for four people.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs. medium-sized squid, cleaned (remove innards and beak along with the film at the back)</li>
            <li>1 piece large yellow onion, preferrably minced. Diced is okay however.</li>
            <li>2 pieces tomatoes (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>5 cloves crushed garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a wok or pot, then pour in the soy sauce, vinegar, and water. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the squid and wait for the liquid to reboil. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat then separate the squid from the liquid. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour in the cooking oil on a separate wok or cooking pot then apply heat.</li>
            <li>When the oil is hot enough, saute the garlic, onions, tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Put the squid back then cook for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour the liquid mixture used to cook the squid a while ago, then bring to a boil and simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the ink, salt, ground black pepper, and sugar. Stir. Simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a bowl then serve.</li>
            <li>Note: For a thicker sauce, remove the squid from the wok or pot then let the sauce boil until enough liquid evaporates or to your desired thickness. Then, top the squid with the sauce.</li>
