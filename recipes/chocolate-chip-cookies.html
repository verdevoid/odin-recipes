    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the only non-Filipino dish, the universally loved chocolate chip cookies. This version
        uses browned butter. There's no need for a mixer, nor creaming the butter and sugar in this recipe.
        It also uses a hint of coffee but does not taste like it. This is a recipe I stumbled across while watching
        YouTube shorts from <a href="https://bakewithzoha.com/chocolate-chip-cookies/">Baking with Zoha</a> and many have loved it.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 tbsp unsalted butter (140g)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup to 2/3 cup packed light or dark brown sugar (100g to 133g); to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar (50g)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant coffee dissolved in 1 teaspoon hot water</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cup all purpose flour (170g)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt (you can reduce to 1/2 tsp if you don't like your cookies to be too salty)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>4 oz dark chocolate, chopped (113g)</li>
        <li>4 oz milk chocolate, chopped (113g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the butter in a non-stick pan and melt it on medium-low heat. Keep stirring for a few minutes
        until the butter starts to look brown and develops a caramel-y nutty aroma.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat all the way to the lowest setting, and add the brown and white sugars. Whisk on the
        lowest flame for 1-2 minutes, then remove from the heat. The heat facilitates the dissolving of the sugars and
        starts breaking them down for a deeper flavor. You are not trying to caramelize or melt the sugars. The mixture
        may look somewhat grainy, don't worry.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and cool the mixture for 5 minutes. It should be warm, but not hot anymore.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and yolk, and quickly whisk to incorporate. Add the vanilla and instant coffee dissolved in
        hot water, and whisk for 1-2 minutes until the mixture becomes very smooth and creamy like caramel. If you see
        any clumps of sugar, press them down with the back of a spoon and they should mix in.</li>
        <li>Sift all the dry ingredients into a separate bowl. Add the chopped chocolate and mix everything
        together.</li>
        <li>Make sure the wet ingredients aren't hot (they shouldn't be). Add the dry ingredients to the wet in 2
        batches and fold with a rubber spatula until just combined. Do not overmix!</li>
        <li>Use a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop to divide the dough into 10 balls (if the dough feels a bit too runny
        to scoop, refrigerate for 10 min first). Don't apply pressure onto the balls, just gently pull them together.</li>
        <li>Place the cookie balls onto a plate or baking sheet, and add a few chocolate chunks on top (you can add
        more chocolate or reserve some of the chopped chocolate from earlier).</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but ideally overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 375F (conventional / no fan) and prepare a large cookie sheet with parchment paper. It
        is best to use a lighter colored cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Transfer the balls to the sheet, keeping at least 3" between them.</li>
        <li>Bake for 11-13 minutes depending on how soft and gooey you want the cookies to be. I always recommend
        baking 1 test cookie first!</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cookies with some flakey sea salt (optional) and let them cool down at room temperature
        for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy while still warm!</li>
    </ol>
