        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the only non-Filipino dish, the universally loved chocolate chip cookies. This version
            uses browned butter. There's no need for a mixer, nor creaming the butter and sugar in this recipe.
            It also uses a hint of coffee but does not taste like it. This is a recipe I stumbled across while watching
            YouTube shorts from <a>Baking with Zoha</a> and many have loved it.
